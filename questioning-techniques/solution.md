# Questioning Techniques
There are numerous questioning techniques that can be used to help us to learn knowledge and skills. To give but one example, there is the "Question Continuum".
- Students devise questions
- Questions written on sticky notes
- Sticky notes arranged on a large board
- X-axis represents order of increasing "interest"
- Y-axis represents increasing complexity

This helps to determine which questions to answer and in which order and provides a context for decoding the current understanding of the material.
