# Reciprocal Teaching
**Reciprocal teaching** is best represented as a _dialogue_ between teachers and students in which participants take turns assuming the role of teacher. [ Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar ]

I teach you, then you teach me.

Typically, reciprocal teaching uses four phases:

## Questioning
Ask yourself questions to check your understanding. This awareness of one's own thought processes is called _metacognition_:

**Metacognition**

_Metacognition_ is _thinking about thinking_. It can take several forms, among them:
- **Person knowledge** (declarative knowledge) which is understanding one's own capabilities.
- **Task knowledge** (procedural knowledge) which is how one perceives the difficulty of a task which is the content, length, and the type of assignment.
- **Strategic knowledge** (conditional knowledge) which is one's own capability for using strategies to learn information.

## Clarifying
_Clarifying_ involves the identification and clarification of unclear, difficult, or unfamiliar aspects of the material. One useful technique for clarifying is _chunking_:

**Chunking**

_Chunking_, in psychology, is a phenomenon whereby individuals group responses when performing a memory task.

Presumably, individuals that exhibit the "chunking" process in their responses are forming clusters of responses based on the items' semantic relatedness or perceptual features. The chunks are often meaningful to the participant.

## Summarizing
_Summarization_ requires the reader to perform the task of discriminating between important and less-important information in the text. It must then be organized into a coherent whole.

## Predicting
Based on your background knowledge and your understanding of the topic, predict what might happen next.
